## Introduction

This section constitutes the Software reuse file (SRF) for
the Generic Processing Orchestration System (G-POS) project.

The first level dependencies are listed in the following sections.

For each dependency, the following information is listed:

- software item name;
- short description of the main features;
- version;
- developer name;
- licensing conditions;
- industrial property and exportability constraints, if any;
- implementation language;
- development and execution environment (e.g. platform, and operating system);

## Compatibility of existing software with project requirements

```{note}
The SRF shall describe which part of the project requirements (RB)
are intended to be implemented through software reuse

For each software item, the SRF shall provide the availability and quality status (completeness, correctness, etc.) of the following information:

  1. software requirements documentation;
  2. software architectural and detailed design documentation;
  3. forward and backward traceability between system requirements;
  4. software requirements, design and code;
  5. unit tests documentation and coverage;
  6. integration tests documentation and coverage;
  7. validation documentation and coverage;
  8. verification reports;
  9. performance (e.g. memory occupation, CPU load);
  10. operational performances;
  11. residual non conformance and waivers;
  12. user operational documentation (e.g. user manual);
  13. code quality (adherence to coding standards, metrics).

c. For each of the points in b, the SRF shall document the quality level of the existing software with respect to the applicable project requirements, according to the criticality of the system function implemented.
```

## Software reuse analysis conclusion

```{note}
The SRF shall document the results of the software reuse analysis.

For each software item, the SRF shall provide the following information:

  1. decision to reuse or not reuse, based on the information provided in previous chapters;
  2. estimated level of reuse;
  3. assumptions and methods applied when estimating the level of reuse.
```

## Detailed results of evaluation

```{note}
The SRF shall include the detailed results of the evaluation.

> NOTE The detailed results of the evaluation can be presented in an appendix.
```

## Corrective actions

```{note}
The SRF shall document any corrective actions identified to ensure that the software intended for reuse meets the applicable project requirements.

The SRF shall document the detailed results of the implementation of the identified corrective actions.
```

## Configuration status

```{note}
The SRF shall include the detailed configuration status of the reused software baseline.
